# Booking App ðŸ“–

## Launch Instructions
1. Using the CLI, navigate to location-where-you-unzipped-this-folder/booking-app/server 
2. Run command `npm start`
3. In another CLI instance, navigate to location-where-you-unzipped-this-file/booking-app/client
4. Run command `npm start`

## User Instructions
1. Check out current bookings.
2. Create a new booking.
3. Enjoy.

## Future Improvements
1. Database structure - I chose all nullable varchar types for simplicity, ideally the data would be more accurately typed.
2. Create a single launch command for server and client.
3. Prevent full page reload after form submit, and re-render the data in a more elegant fashion.
4. Form validation - this is a big one! I don't have any currently - the entire form could be submitted blank or with garbage.
5. More sophisticated backend architecture - i.e. models/controllers.
